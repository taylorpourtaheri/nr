Description: noderank maps differential gene expression results 
    onto an established network of protein-protein associations and 
    employs network analysis methods to select a prioritized list of 
    important nodes. For data in which the mechanism of perturbation is 
    known, each ranked list result is scored by the position of the 
    causal gene.
